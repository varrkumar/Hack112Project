Hack 112 Project: My CMU Nutrition Plan

Description: 
Our app is designed to promote nutritional eating habits for a healthier CMU community. 

Based on the collected user's weight, sex, height, age, target weight and current calorie intake, our app calculates the user's BMI, BMR, required calorie intake based on their person fitness goal (to lose weight, gain muscle or maintain weight), and provides an estimate of how many weeks it would take to reach that goal.

Using the calculated recommended calorie range, it displays personalized meal results that includes the CMU restaurant name, the meal item name and its calories. 
This allows the user to make health-conscious choices when it comes to choosing what to eat on CMU campus. 

The goal of the My CMU Nutrition Plan app is to cater to user's personalized goals and promote healthier lifestyles on CMU campus in an easy and accessible way!
